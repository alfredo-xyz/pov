From the experiments with stop motion and cartoon animation in his student years, to visual effects, editing and 3D animation of today; his focus has always been to link artistic skills with technological skills.

His background as Producer, Editor and Associate Creative Director in the advertising industry gives him a unique perspective that enriches each project he undertakes.

As an independent producer and now as an entrepreneur, Antonio has been developing his skills in Post-production: editing, motion graphics, 2D and 3D animation, visual effects and compositing. He has knowledge of multiple tools but his weapon of choice is Autodesk Smoke; a high-end visual effects platform that combines editing, 3D compositing and color grading in an integrated manner.

Antonio will ensure high precision and quality to any project.
